# Rook Modified

Welcome to my fork of the [Rook](https://github.com/rolohaun/Rook) DIY 3D Printer by [Rolohaun 3D](https://github.com/rolohaun)

There were a few tweaks I wished to make to the original project to suit my own needs and make use of some spares.

As stated in the original project, this is a small CoreXY 3D printer with a 120x120 build volume

This is a work in progress, see below for planned modifications

For now you no BOM is yet provided, but is largely similar to the original BOM [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oHDEvndkkvPFOBis4atrHRHK_DMTvttFUFWDg2He6To/edit#gid=0)
